# JAVASCRIPT

Run the project using 
Static -a 0.0.0.0 and open localhost:8080 in the browser.

Observations so far:

1)	IE7 doesn’t support appending of table rows to the table. Hence used appropriate way.
2)	Once the result is printed in the table,  search pattern is saved in firefox even after refresh where as in chrome it is cleared.
3)	Change in json is updated in seconds in chrome where as in firefox it is not updated
4)	When using getElementById, name should also be used because IE6 and 7 doesn’t give appropriate results because it searches "name" attribute of an element along with "id"
